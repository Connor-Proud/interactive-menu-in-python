I had an idea to create an interactive menu in python that ran through the terminal.
I first started by trying to use the pygame module to handle keyboard inputs however i quickly realised that this wouldn't work.
i then moved onto using the keyboard module and this worked well.
as an example i put car manufacturers and some of their cars for both people and myself to understand what is happening at what time.

this program should help others in making their own interactive program in python
